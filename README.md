## Overview 
Connect Clique is a web application that targets busy people who want to meet up with their friends and avoid the complications of organising a meetup date and time. Users create an activity and their friends can vote for a time and date that better suits them. When all the people have voted, the date and time with the most votes get added to their in-app calendar. 

## Features

- Vote for favourite date and time for activities.
- Search for an activity.
- Add and remove other users to my friends list.
