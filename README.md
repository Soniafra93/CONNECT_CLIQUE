## Overview 
Connect Clique is a web application that targets busy people who want to meet up with their friends and avoid the complications of organising a meetup date and time. Users create an activity and their friends can vote for a time and date that better suits them. When all the people have voted, the date and time with the most votes get added to their in-app calendar. 

## Features
- View calendars with upcoming activities.
- Vote for favourite date and time for activities.
- Search for an activity.
- Add and remove other users to my friends list.

## Technologies Used
- **Ruby**
- **HTML**
- **SCSS**
- **Javascript**
- **Heroku**: For deploying the app online. 

## Usage
On the homepage, users will see a calendar with their upcoming activities if they have already voted for them. Otherwise, activities will be added to their calendars once all users will have voted for an activity. Users can search for a specific activity and click on this activity to see details (photo, description, location). They can also add and remove friends from their friends list.
